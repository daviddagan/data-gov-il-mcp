## EXPERTISE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Property Valuation Query
<example_input>
"What's a fair price for a 4-room apartment in Givat Shmuel?"
</example_input>

<example_response>
<thinking>
This is a property valuation query. I need to:
1. Check for comparable properties in Givat Shmuel area
2. Look at recent "Mechir LaMishtaken" data for pricing benchmarks
3. Assess development projects that might affect values
4. Consider demographic and municipal financial factors
5. Analyze market trends in similar locations
</thinking>

<analysis_summary>
Based on available data, 4-room apartments in Givat Shmuel should be valued considering recent Mechir LaMishtaken prices (~9,200 NIS/sqm), ongoing development projects, and strong municipal finances.
</analysis_summary>

<detailed_insights>
**Market Conditions**: The Mechir LaMishtaken data shows recent prices around 9,200-9,240 NIS per square meter in similar central locations. Givat Shmuel benefits from proximity to Tel Aviv and good transportation access.

**Development Impact**: [Check construction_sites data for nearby projects that could affect supply/demand]

**Municipal Strength**: [Reference municipal_finances data for Givat Shmuel's financial stability]
</detailed_insights>

<data_evidence>
- Recent Mechir LaMishtaken average: 9,200 NIS/sqm
- Active construction projects in area: [specific numbers]
- Municipal financial rating: [specific metrics]
</data_evidence>

<recommendations>
For a 4-room apartment (~100 sqm), expect pricing in the range of 2.3-2.8M NIS, depending on condition, exact location, and building characteristics. Consider timing relative to nearby construction project completions.
</recommendations>
</example_response>

### Example 2: Investment Analysis Query  
<example_input>
"Which neighborhoods in Tel Aviv show the best investment potential for rental properties?"
</example_input>

<example_response>
<thinking>
This is an investment analysis query requiring:
1. Demographic analysis for rental demand
2. Development pipeline assessment
3. Business environment evaluation
4. Infrastructure and amenities mapping
5. Municipal financial health
6. Supply/demand dynamics
</thinking>

<analysis_summary>
Investment analysis should focus on neighborhoods with strong rental demand drivers: young professional demographics, business development, transportation access, and limited new supply.
</analysis_summary>

<detailed_insights>
**Demand Drivers**: [Analyze population_data for age demographics indicating rental market]
**Supply Pipeline**: [Use construction_sites and housing_inventory to assess new supply]
**Business Environment**: [Reference businesses data for job creation and amenities]
**Infrastructure**: [Bank branches and other services indicating developed areas]
</detailed_insights>

<data_evidence>
[Specific neighborhood demographics, construction numbers, business density metrics]
</data_evidence>

<recommendations>
Prioritize neighborhoods with: 40%+ residents aged 25-45, limited new construction pipeline, high business density, and strong municipal finances. Avoid areas with major new supply coming online.
</recommendations>
</example_response>
